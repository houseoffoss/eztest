# EZTest — Full Documentation for LLMs

> EZTest is a lightweight, open-source, self-hosted test management platform built for modern QA and engineering teams. Organize test cases, suites, runs, and defects in one transparent platform.

## Overview

EZTest is an open-source test management platform that provides a structured workflow for managing both manual and automated tests. It helps QA and engineering teams stay organized and move with confidence through the entire testing lifecycle.

Developed by Belsterns and available through House Of FOSS for managed hosting, EZTest is licensed under AGPL-3.0 and is completely free to use and self-host.

## Core Concepts

### Projects
Projects are the top-level organizational unit. Each project contains its own test cases, test suites, test runs, defects, and team members. Projects have configurable settings and support role-based access control.

### Test Cases
Test cases are the fundamental building blocks. Each test case includes:
- Title and description
- Priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Type (Functional, Regression, Smoke, Integration, etc.)
- Status (Draft, Active, Deprecated)
- Step-by-step test steps with expected results
- File attachments (screenshots, documents)
- Linked defects for traceability
- Execution history across test runs

### Test Suites
Test suites group related test cases for organized test planning. Features include:
- Hierarchical organization within projects
- Ability to add/remove test cases
- Suite-level metadata and descriptions

### Test Runs
Test runs represent a specific execution cycle. Features include:
- Select test cases or suites to include in a run
- Record individual test case results (Pass, Fail, Blocked, Skipped)
- Add comments and attachments to results
- Track execution progress and completion status
- Export results for reporting
- XML import/export for CI/CD integration (JUnit format)
- Email reporting capabilities

### Defects
Defect tracking is integrated directly into the testing workflow:
- Create defects linked to specific test cases
- Assign defects to team members
- Track defect status and resolution
- Bulk operations (assign, status change, delete)
- File attachments for evidence
- Email notifications for assignments

### Modules
Modules provide hierarchical organization for test cases within a project:
- Create nested module structures
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Filter test cases by module

## Key Features

### Test Case Management
- Create, edit, and organize test cases with rich metadata
- Define step-by-step test procedures with expected results
- Attach files and screenshots to test cases and steps
- Import test cases from CSV files
- Export test cases to CSV for backup or migration
- Bulk operations for efficient management

### Test Execution
- Create test runs from selected test cases or suites
- Record pass/fail/blocked/skipped results per test case
- Add execution notes and attachments
- Track execution progress in real-time
- Complete or abort test runs
- Generate and email test run reports

### Defect Tracking
- Integrated defect logging from test results
- Link defects to test cases for traceability
- Assign defects to team members with email notifications
- Track defect lifecycle (Open, In Progress, Fixed, Closed, etc.)
- Bulk status updates and assignments
- Import/export defect data

### Project Management
- Create and configure multiple projects
- Invite and manage team members
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Tester, Viewer)
- Project-level settings and customization
- Dashboard with project statistics and metrics

### Import & Export
- CSV import/export for test cases
- CSV import/export for defects
- XML (JUnit) import/export for test runs
- Interoperability with CI/CD pipelines

### Collaboration
- Comment system on defects and test cases
- File attachments on comments
- Email notifications for assignments and updates
- Team member management per project

### Administration
- User management (create, edit, deactivate users)
- Customizable dropdown options (priorities, statuses, types)
- System-wide configuration
- API key management for integrations

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend & Backend**: Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with credentials provider
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible object storage (AWS S3, MinIO, etc.)
- **Email**: SMTP integration for notifications
- **Analytics**: Optional Firebase Analytics
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphism design system

### Deployment Options
1. **Self-Hosted with Docker**: Full Docker support with docker-compose for easy deployment
2. **Standalone Node.js**: Build and run as a standalone Next.js application
3. **Managed Hosting via House Of FOSS**: Fully managed deployment with enterprise support

### API
EZTest provides a comprehensive REST API covering:
- Projects CRUD and management
- Test cases CRUD with steps and attachments
- Test suites CRUD with test case associations
- Test runs CRUD with result recording
- Defects CRUD with assignments
- User management and authentication
- File upload/download (multipart S3 uploads)
- Import/export endpoints

## Pricing

EZTest is **100% free and open-source** under the AGPL-3.0 license. There are no per-user fees, no feature gates, and no premium tiers.

For managed hosting through House Of FOSS, you pay only for server usage (not per user), which can save up to 60% compared to commercial test management tools.

## Comparison with Alternatives

EZTest is designed as a transparent, self-hosted alternative to commercial test management tools like:
- TestRail
- Zephyr
- qTest
- PractiTest

Key differentiators:
- **Open Source**: Full source code access, no vendor lock-in
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete data ownership and privacy
- **No Per-User Pricing**: Unlimited users at no additional cost
- **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and modern web technologies
- **Lightweight**: Minimal infrastructure requirements
- **Extensible**: API-first design for custom integrations
